## 4-Panel Prompt (Recommended)

```
Create a comic with the title: Getting Started with Persona - Generate Realistic User Personas from Your Data

Panel 1: A UX researcher sits at their desk surrounded by interview transcripts, survey printouts, sticky notes, and affinity diagrams. They look exhausted, with a thought bubble showing scattered user quotes and question marks: "Who are our actual users?" and "I've read 50 interviews but can't see the patterns..." A wall behind them has half-finished persona posters with gaps and question marks. The scene is drawn in a warm, loose sketch style with expressive pencil lines and soft marker shading. Earth tones and muted blues create a cosy but chaotic atmosphere. At the bottom, text reads: "Drowning in research data. Still no personas."

Panel 2: The same researcher, now looking curious and hopeful, types commands into their terminal. The screen shows "persona experiment create 'user-study'" followed by "persona generate --from data/". Research documents (interview transcripts, survey CSVs, notes) flow into the computer like a gentle stream, transforming into glowing organised blocks. A small mascot character (friendly robot or owl with a researcher's glasses) gives a thumbs up. The sketch style remains warm and approachable, with the terminal rendered in a non-intimidating way - rounded corners, soft colours. Text reads: "Point Persona at your research files. It reads interviews, surveys, notes - everything."

Panel 3: The researcher leans forward excitedly as the terminal shows AI processing with a thinking indicator. Around them, faint sketchy outlines show different personas emerging - diverse faces forming from connected data points, with dotted lines linking quotes to persona attributes. Speech bubbles from the forming personas show snippets: "I need faster synthesis..." and "Evidence matters to me." The style is dynamic, showing AI intelligence at work. Text reads: "AI analyses your data and discovers real user patterns."

Panel 4: The researcher sits back with a satisfied smile, reviewing beautifully formatted persona cards on their screen. Each persona has clear attributes with small citation tags linking back to source data (e.g., "Interview 3, line 45"). The messy desk from Panel 1 is now tidy, and the wall shows completed, polished persona posters. A speech bubble from the researcher says "Every detail traced back to real evidence!" The friendly mascot appears again, perhaps holding a citation flag. The overall tone is triumphant and empowering. Text reads: "Evidence-linked personas. Your research, transformed."

The overall tone should feel friendly, empowering, and accessible - like a helpful colleague showing you a powerful new research tool rather than a technical manual. The hand-drawn sketch aesthetic should make AI feel warm and human. Make the aspect ratio 16:9.

## 3-Panel Prompt (Condensed)

```
Create a comic with the title: Meet Persona - From Research Data to User Personas

Panel 1: A researcher drowning in a sea of interview transcripts, survey responses, and sticky notes. Loose sketch style with warm pencil lines and soft marker colours. Papers float around them with labels like "Interview 12", "Survey Data", "User Quotes". A half-finished persona poster on the wall has gaps and question marks. A thought bubble shows "I KNOW there are patterns here..." Text at bottom: "Research data is everywhere. Personas are nowhere."

Panel 2: Split panel showing transformation. Left side: the researcher types "persona experiment create 'study'" and "persona generate --from data/" - research files stream into a glowing organised system. Right side: AI processes the data, with diverse user faces emerging from connected quote bubbles and data points. The sketch style is warm and approachable, making the terminal feel friendly rather than intimidating. Text reads: "Persona reads your research and generates evidence-linked user personas - powered by AI you choose."

Panel 3: The researcher, now relaxed and confident, presents polished persona cards to colleagues. Each card shows a realistic user with attributes clearly linked to source citations: "Based on interviews 3, 7, 12". The audience nods approvingly. A small friendly mascot (robot or owl with glasses) gives a thumbs up. The researcher's speech bubble says "And I can show exactly where each insight came from!" Text at bottom: "Your research. Your personas. Every detail backed by evidence."

Warm, loose hand-drawn sketch style throughout. Make it feel like a friendly tutorial, not a technical manual. Aspect ratio 16:9.

## Customisation Notes

### Mascot
The prompts include an optional mascot (robot or owl with researcher's glasses) for personality. Remove these references if you prefer a mascot-free approach.

### Terminal Display
Kept minimal and friendly - just the essential commands without intimidating syntax.

### Evidence Emphasis
The "evidence-linked" aspect is woven throughout as this is Persona's key differentiator - every attribute traced to source data.

### Adjustable Elements

- **Commands**: Adjust `persona experiment create` and `persona generate` to match current CLI syntax
- **Data types**: Change "interviews, surveys, notes" to match your typical use case
- **Citation format**: Adjust "Interview 3, line 45" to your preferred citation style
- **Mascot**: Adjust type (robot, owl, other) or remove entirely
- **Aspect ratio**: Currently 16:9, adjust for your platform
