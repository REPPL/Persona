Learn to interpret and evaluate the personas generated by Persona.

**Level:** Beginner | **Time:** 10 minutes

## What You'll Learn

- Anatomy of a generated persona (JSON structure)
- Reading the Markdown output
- Understanding metadata (tokens, cost, model)
- What makes a good vs poor persona
- When to regenerate vs refine

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md)
- At least one generated persona

## The Output Structure

When Persona generates personas, it creates a structured output folder:

```
outputs/20241213_143022/
├── metadata.json      # Generation metadata
├── prompt.json        # The prompt template used
├── files.txt          # Source files processed
├── full_output.txt    # Complete LLM response
└── personas/
    ├── 01/
    │   ├── persona.txt   # Human-readable format
    │   └── persona.json  # Structured data
    ├── 02/
    └── 03/
```

Let's explore each component.

## Step 1: Understanding metadata.json

Open the metadata file to see generation details:

```bash
cat outputs/20241213_143022/metadata.json | python -m json.tool
```

**Key fields:**

```json
{
  "experiment": "my-first-experiment",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-13T14:30:22Z",
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "tokens": {
    "input": 1247,
    "output": 1893,
    "total": 3140
  },
  "cost": {
    "input": 0.03,
    "output": 0.05,
    "total": 0.08
  },
  "personas_generated": 3,
  "source_files": ["interviews.csv", "survey.json"]
}
```

**What this tells you:**
- **Provider/model:** Which AI generated these personas
- **Tokens:** How much data was processed
- **Cost:** Actual API cost incurred
- **Source files:** What data was used

## Step 2: Reading the Persona JSON

The JSON file contains structured persona data:

```bash
cat personas/01/persona.json | python -m json.tool
```

**Example structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "persona-001",
  "name": "Sarah Chen",
  "title": "The Mobile Professional",
  "demographics": {
    "age_range": "30-35",
    "occupation": "Marketing Manager",
    "tech_proficiency": "Intermediate",
    "location": "Urban"
  },
  "goals": [
    "Complete tasks efficiently on mobile",
    "Stay productive during commutes",
    "Access key features offline"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "Frustration when features don't work offline",
    "Too many options overwhelming on small screen",
    "Difficulty finding help documentation"
  ],
  "behaviours": [
    "Checks app during morning commute",
    "Prefers mobile over desktop for quick tasks",
    "Uses voice commands when hands-free"
  ],
  "quotes": [
    "I need this to work when I'm on the tube with no signal",
    "If I can't find it in 3 taps, I give up"
  ]
}
```

**Why JSON matters:**
- Integrates with other tools
- Enables programmatic analysis
- Consistent structure for comparison

## Step 3: Reading the Human-Friendly Format

The `.txt` file is formatted for reading and sharing:

```bash
cat personas/01/persona.txt
```

**Example:**

```markdown
# Sarah Chen - The Mobile Professional

## Demographics
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age Range | 30-35 |
| Occupation | Marketing Manager |
| Tech Proficiency | Intermediate |
| Location | Urban |

## Goals
- Complete tasks efficiently on mobile
- Stay productive during commutes
- Access key features offline

## Pain Points
- Frustration when features don't work offline
- Too many options overwhelming on small screen
- Difficulty finding help documentation

## Key Behaviours
- Checks app during morning commute
- Prefers mobile over desktop for quick tasks
- Uses voice commands when hands-free

## Representative Quotes
> "I need this to work when I'm on the tube with no signal"
> "If I can't find it in 3 taps, I give up"
```

**This format is ideal for:**
- Sharing with stakeholders
- Including in presentations
- Pasting into design documents

## Step 4: Evaluating Persona Quality

Not all generated personas are equally useful. Here's how to assess quality:

### Signs of a Good Persona

| Quality | Indicator |
|---------|-----------|
| **Specific** | Concrete details, not generalisations |
| **Consistent** | Behaviours align with goals and pain points |
| **Grounded** | Quotes sound natural, from real data |
| **Distinct** | Each persona is clearly different |
| **Actionable** | Informs design decisions |

### Signs of a Poor Persona

| Problem | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Too generic** | "Users want things to be easy" |
| **Contradictory** | Tech-savvy but "confused by menus" |
| **Hallucinated** | Details not in source data |
| **Stereotypical** | "Millennial who loves social media" |
| **Overlapping** | Two personas are nearly identical |

### Quick Quality Checklist

- [ ] Can you picture this person?
- [ ] Would you design differently for them vs another persona?
- [ ] Do quotes feel authentic to your research?
- [ ] Are pain points specific enough to address?

## Step 5: When to Regenerate vs Refine

**Regenerate** (run generation again) when:
- Output is fundamentally wrong
- Personas miss major user segments
- Quality is consistently poor
- You've added more source data

**Refine** (adjust and iterate) when:
- One persona needs adjustment
- Minor inconsistencies to fix
- Want to emphasise different traits
- Exploring variations

**Tips for better regeneration:**
1. Add more source data
2. Try a different model
3. Adjust the persona count
4. Check data quality

## Understanding the Cost

Each generation has a cost. Understanding it helps budget:

```
Cost Breakdown:
───────────────────────────────────
Input tokens:  1,247 @ $2.50/1M = $0.003
Output tokens: 1,893 @ $10/1M  = $0.019
Total: $0.022
```

**Factors affecting cost:**
- **Data size:** More text = more input tokens
- **Persona count:** More personas = more output tokens
- **Model choice:** GPT-4 > Claude 3 > GPT-3.5 (typically)

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the output:

1. **[Working with Data Formats](03-data-formats.md)** - Learn to prepare different data types
2. **[Comparing Providers](04-comparing-providers.md)** - See how different models perform
3. **[Validating Quality](06-validating-quality.md)** - Ensure personas reflect your data
