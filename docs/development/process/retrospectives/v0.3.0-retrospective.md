# Retrospective: v0.3.0 - Multi-Variation

## What Went Well

- **Research-Based Design**: Bias mitigation for synthetic data (F-028) followed R-003 and R-008 research findings
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 173 new tests across 5 modules, all passing with strong coverage of edge cases
- **Modular Architecture**: Each feature (synthetic, empathy map, workshop, variations) is self-contained with clear interfaces
- **Integration Compatibility**: Workshop import generates YAML that loads directly into empathy map loader

## What Could Be Improved

- **Feature Interdependence**: F-033, F-034, and F-035 were more tightly coupled than expected - implementing together was more efficient but required more planning
- **Mock System Depth**: Workshop import uses mock vision extractor; real LLM integration will need careful testing
- **Test Data Variety**: Bias mitigation tests could include more diverse scenarios

## Lessons Learned

- **Related Features Together**: When features share enums or data structures, implementing them in a single module reduces duplication
- **Bias by Default**: Building bias mitigation into the design from the start is easier than retrofitting
- **Protocol Pattern**: Using Python Protocol for VisionExtractor enables easy mocking without inheritance complexity

## Decisions Made

- **Synthetic Data**: Gender-neutral IDs (P001), no names, role-based identification per R-008
- **Empathy Map Dimensions**: Five Boag dimensions (Tasks, Feelings, Influences, Pain Points, Goals)
- **Variation Matrix**: 6 variations from 3 complexity levels x 2 detail levels
- **Token Multipliers**: Simple/minimal = 0.3x baseline, Complex/detailed = 2.5x baseline

## Metrics

- **Features implemented**: 7 (F-028, F-029, F-030, F-031, F-033, F-034, F-035)
- **Test count**: 173 new tests
- **Test coverage**: ~80%
- **Modules created**: 5 (synthetic/generator, data/empathy_map, data/workshop, output/empathy_table, generation/variations)
- **Lines of code**: ~2,500 lines Python
