## Process Overview

Persona uses a phased implementation workflow with AI transparency:

1. **Phase 0: Setup** - Branch, session file, readiness check
2. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Base components, tests, commit
3. **Phase 2: Core Features** - Feature implementation with testing
4. **Phase 3: Polish** - Error handling, documentation audit
5. **Phase 4: Release** - UAT, security audit, retrospective, merge

See [workflow.md](workflow.md) for details.
