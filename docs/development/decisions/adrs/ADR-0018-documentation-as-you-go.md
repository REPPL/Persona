# ADR-0018: Documentation As You Go

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Documentation can be:
- Written after implementation
- Written before implementation
- Written alongside implementation

## Decision

Documentation as you go:
- Feature specs written before implementation
- Implementation records capture what was built
- Documentation sync checkpoint before commits
- Devlogs capture reasoning

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Documentation never lags
- Specs guide implementation
- Reasoning captured fresh
- Lower documentation debt

**Negative:**
- Upfront documentation effort
- May need updates during implementation
- More process overhead
