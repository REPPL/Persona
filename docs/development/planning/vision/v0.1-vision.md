# v0.1.0 Vision: Foundation

The foundation release establishing basic persona generation capability.

## Theme

**"Data to Personas"** - The essential generation loop.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Working Generation Pipeline**
   - Load data from common formats (CSV, JSON, TXT, Markdown, YAML)
   - Send to LLM for analysis
   - Output structured personas

2. **Multi-Provider Support**
   - OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o)
   - Anthropic (Claude)
   - Google (Gemini)

3. **Experiment Workflow**
   - Create, list, show, delete experiments
   - Self-contained experiment directories
   - Timestamped outputs

4. **Cost Transparency**
   - Estimate costs before generation
   - Display pricing information
   - Record actual costs in metadata

5. **Beautiful CLI**
   - Rich-formatted output
   - Interactive prompts
   - Progress indicators

## Non-Goals for v0.1.0

| Feature | Deferred To | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Multi-step workflows | v0.2.0 | Foundation must be stable first |
| Multi-variation generation | v0.3.0 | Depends on workflows |
| Custom configuration wizards | v0.5.0 | Extensibility phase |
| Security hardening | v0.6.0 | Dedicated security phase |
| Batch folder processing | v0.7.0 | Advanced feature |

## Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
Start with single-step generation. Complexity comes later.

### 2. User-Facing Quality
Every user interaction should be polished - beautiful output, clear errors.

### 3. Test Alongside
No feature is complete without tests. 80% coverage minimum.

### 4. Document As We Go
Features documented before implementation begins.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can generate personas from CSV/JSON/TXT data
- [ ] Three LLM providers work interchangeably
- [ ] Experiments organise work reproducibly
- [ ] Cost estimated before generation
- [ ] Output includes JSON and Markdown personas
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Getting Started tutorial validates all use cases
