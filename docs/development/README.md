# Development Documentation

Developer documentation for the Persona project.

## Documentation Structure

| Section | Purpose | Audience |
|---------|---------|----------|
| [Lineage](lineage/) | PersonaZero analysis and lessons learned | All developers |
| [Planning](planning/) | Vision and architecture | Architects |

## Hybrid Specification Approach

Persona uses a three-layer specification approach:

```
Layer 1: USE CASES (Why)
    ↓ derive
Layer 2: FEATURE SPECS (What)
    ↓ validate
Layer 3: TUTORIALS (How)
```

- **Use Cases** define user intent → [Use Cases](../use-cases/)
- **Feature Specs** define implementation → [Features](roadmap/features/)
- **Tutorials** validate user experience → [Tutorials](../tutorials/)
