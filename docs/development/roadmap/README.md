## Feature-Centric Approach

Features are the primary unit of work. Versions/milestones are bundles of features shipped together.

- **Features** = discrete pieces of value (the work)
- **Milestones** = bundles of features shipped together (the delivery)

Status is tracked by folder location:
- `features/active/` → 🔄 In Progress
- `features/planned/` → 📋 Planned
- `features/completed/` → ✅ Done
