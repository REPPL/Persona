# Milestone: v0.3.0 - Multi-Variation Generation

Test different settings in a single run.

## Goal

Enable users to generate personas with multiple complexity and detail levels simultaneously, then compare results.

## Theme

**"Test and Compare"** - Quality optimisation.

## Features Included (8)

| ID | Feature | Category |
|----|---------|----------|
| F-028 | Complexity levels (simple, moderate, complex) | Variation |
| F-029 | Detail levels (minimal, detailed) | Variation |
| F-030 | Variation combinations | Variation |
| F-031 | Multi-variation output structure | Output |
| F-032 | Variation comparison & analysis | Analysis |
| F-033 | Variation rankings | Analysis |
| F-034 | Cost estimation for variations | Cost |
| F-035 | Compare command | CLI |
