## F-126: URL Data Ingestion

Enable persona generation directly from web URLs, supporting various content types and respecting robots.txt and rate limiting.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Fetch and parse content from HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Support HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text formats
- Content caching to avoid redundant fetches
- Terms acceptance for remote data sources
- Rate limiting and respectful crawling

**CLI Integration:**
```bash
persona generate --from https://example.com/data.csv --accept-terms
persona generate --from https://api.example.com/interviews.json --no-cache
```

## F-127: Project Automation Infrastructure

Establish comprehensive automation for development workflows, Docker deployment, and CI/CD pipelines.

**Key Deliverables:**
- `Makefile` with standard targets (install, dev, test, lint, etc.)
- `scripts/setup.sh` for developer onboarding
- `scripts/release.sh` for release automation
- Docker support (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- GitHub workflows for releases and documentation

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] URL data sources work with `persona generate --from <url>`
- [x] `--accept-terms` flag required for remote URLs
- [x] Content caching reduces redundant fetches
- [x] `make help` shows all available targets
- [x] `./scripts/setup.sh` completes successfully on fresh clone
- [x] Docker containers build and run successfully
- [x] GitHub release workflow creates releases on tag push

---

## Non-Goals

- Web scraping complex JavaScript-rendered pages
- Authentication for protected URLs (future enhancement)
- Kubernetes deployment (future enhancement)
