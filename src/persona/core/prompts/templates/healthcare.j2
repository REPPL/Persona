{% if complexity == 'simple' %}
Keep the personas concise with key healthcare-relevant attributes only.

Create detailed personas with comprehensive health journey information.
{% else %}
Create moderately detailed personas balancing depth with clinical relevance.
{% endif %}

{% if detail_level == 'minimal' %}
Include: name, condition/context, key health goals, main barriers to care.
{% elif detail_level == 'detailed' %}
Include: full demographics, health history context, care preferences, support network, technology comfort, communication preferences.
