## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Can you walk me through a typical design project?

**Participant:** Sure. It usually starts with a brief from product or stakeholders. I'll do a quick competitive analysis, then move into user research - typically interviews or surveys depending on the timeline. From there, I sketch concepts, create wireframes in Figma, get feedback, iterate, and eventually hand off to development.

**Interviewer:** What tools are essential for your work?

**Participant:** Figma is central to everything - we use it for design, prototyping, and even documentation. For user research, I use Maze for unmoderated testing and Loom for recording feedback sessions. Notion keeps all our research organised. For accessibility testing, I rely on browser extensions like axe and colour contrast checkers.

**Interviewer:** What challenges do you face in user research?

**Participant:** Recruiting the right participants is always hard. We have a database of users who've opted in, but they're not always representative of our target audience. And getting stakeholders to actually watch research sessions instead of just reading summaries - that's an ongoing battle.

**Interviewer:** How do you ensure your designs are accessible?

**Participant:** It's built into my process now. I design with accessibility in mind from the start - considering colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. I use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as my baseline. But honestly, our company is still learning. Not everyone understands why accessibility matters beyond legal compliance.

**Interviewer:** What's your biggest frustration?

**Participant:** Developers implementing designs without consulting us first. I'll hand off a carefully crafted design, and then see something completely different in production because "it was easier this way." We're working on better design-dev collaboration, but there's a cultural gap.

Also, stakeholders changing requirements mid-project without understanding the impact. A "small" copy change can affect the entire layout.

**Interviewer:** How do you measure the success of your designs?

**Participant:** A mix of quantitative and qualitative. We track conversion rates, task completion times, and error rates. But I also value user feedback - are people delighted or merely satisfied? We do regular usability tests to catch issues before they become habits.

**Interviewer:** What would improve your workflow?

**Participant:** A proper design system would save so much time. We have components, but they're not well-documented or consistently used. Every project involves reinventing basic elements.

Better analytics integration would help too. Right now, getting data about how people actually use our designs requires asking our data team, which takes days.

**Interviewer:** How do you stay current with design trends?

**Participant:** I follow design communities on Twitter and LinkedIn, read articles on Nielsen Norman Group and Smashing Magazine. Conferences like Config and local UX meetups keep me inspired. But I try not to chase trends blindly - what works for one product might not work for another.
