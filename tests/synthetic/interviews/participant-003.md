## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Describe your role in the organisation.

**Participant:** I'm a PM for our analytics platform. I own the product roadmap, work closely with engineering and design, and manage stakeholder expectations. My job is to figure out what we should build, why, and when - then make sure we actually deliver value.

**Interviewer:** How do you decide what features to prioritise?

**Participant:** It's a combination of customer feedback, business goals, and technical feasibility. We use a scoring framework that considers revenue impact, customer reach, effort required, and strategic alignment. But honestly, it's not purely mathematical - there's always judgment involved.

**Interviewer:** What's your biggest challenge?

**Participant:** Saying no. Everyone has feature requests - sales wants this, support escalates that, executives have their pet projects. My job is to focus the team on what matters most, but that means disappointing people regularly.

**Interviewer:** How do you gather customer insights?

**Participant:** Multiple channels. We do quarterly NPS surveys, monitor support tickets for patterns, have regular calls with key accounts, and analyse product usage data. I try to do at least two customer calls per week to stay connected to real problems.

**Interviewer:** How do you measure product success?

**Participant:** OKRs quarterly, with metrics like activation rate, feature adoption, retention, and expansion revenue. But I'm careful about vanity metrics - a feature can have high usage but not actually solve the problem we intended.

**Interviewer:** What frustrates you about product management?

**Participant:** The endless meetings. Some days I'm in back-to-back calls from 9 to 5, leaving no time to actually think strategically. I've started protecting Thursday mornings for deep work, but it's a constant battle.

**Interviewer:** How do you work with engineering teams?

**Participant:** Close collaboration from the start. I don't just hand over requirements - I involve engineers in problem discovery so they understand the context. They often have technical insights that change how we approach solutions.

**Interviewer:** What would make your job easier?

**Participant:** Better data infrastructure. Getting answers about user behaviour often requires custom SQL queries and waiting for the data team. Self-serve analytics would be game-changing.

Also, more alignment across leadership. When executives aren't on the same page about priorities, it creates chaos for product teams.
